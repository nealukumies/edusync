## How to Run Locally
Before running the application, start the backend service. Follow the instructions in the backend repository: [EduSync Backend](https://github.com/nealukumies/edusync-backend/)

To run the frontend application locally, follow these steps:
### Using an IDE:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Compile the project using your IDE`s build tools or Maven.
4. Run the `Main` class in the layout_model package to start the application.
5. The application window will open, and you can start using the app.

### Using Command Line:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd edusync
   ```
3. Compile the project using Maven:
   ```bash
      mvn clean install
    ```
4. Run the application using the following command:
5.   ```bash
      java -jar target/edusync-client.jar
      ```
6. The application window will open, and you can start using the app.

### Using Docker:
1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd edusync
   ```
4. Build the Docker image using Docker compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
The application window will open, and you can start using the app.
